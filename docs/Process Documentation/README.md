### Need tool-by-tool instructions?
- Head over to the [Tool-Specific Delivery Playbooks](tools/README.md) for walkthroughs that call out the exact steps inside VS Code, IBM Navigator, IBM Data Studio, 5250/PDM, and related utilities for each task above.

### Want to see a completed example?
- Review the [End-to-End Example Runs](examples/README.md) for realistic scenarios that show how each checklist is executed, which artifacts to collect, and how to close the loop with IBM i teams.
