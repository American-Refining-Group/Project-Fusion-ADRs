## Context

This decision addresses the approach to managing grid-level data interactions — specifically filtering, sorting, and pagination — for data-driven UI components.

Two architectural options were considered for handling these features:

Client-Side Handling – Load the dataset once from the API and allow all interactions (filtering, sorting, pagination) to occur entirely in the browser.
Server-Side Handling – Rely on backend API endpoints to execute filtering, sorting, and pagination for every user interaction.
The system in question needs to handle datasets that may be large in some cases, but are typically manageable in size after user-driven filtering.

---

## Decision

The architecture will implement client-side filtering, sorting, and pagination for grid components.

To support this:

The UI will include filter inputs and a "Search" button that users must use to initiate data retrieval.
Upon clicking "Search", the frontend will send a request to the API including any provided filter criteria.
The API will return a page of data (default size of 500 records or fewer) along with offset-based pagination metadata.
All grid operations (filtering, sorting, pagination) will then be handled entirely client-side using the retrieved data.
In addition:

The API will implement standardized filtering and sorting behavior for all relevant endpoints. This ensures consistency and reusability of query logic across the application.
Every API endpoint will support:
Sorting via query parameters in ascending/descending order.
Filtering on text fields (equality) and numeric fields (equality, greater than, less than, and range).
If the total number of matching records exceeds the initial page size (default limit = 500), the API will not return an error. Instead, it will return a nextPageUrl that can be used to fetch additional pages of data.

---

## Reasoning

### Performance and User Experience

Interactions like filtering and sorting are executed instantly in the browser, eliminating round trips to the server and improving responsiveness.
Users control when and how data is retrieved, reducing backend load and improving perceived speed.
### Simplicity

Reduces complexity in the frontend-to-backend interaction model.
Decreases backend logic for grid state handling.
Encourages standardization of query patterns across endpoints.
### Scalable Pagination

Using offset and limit enables scalable data retrieval while avoiding hard failures due to record caps.
Providing metadata like nextPageUrl and totalRecords gives clients full control if they need to fetch more data explicitly.
---

## REST API Capabilities

Even though grid operations are handled client-side after data retrieval, the REST API will support consistent and standardized pagination, filtering, and sorting behavior:

### Filtering

Text fields: Supports equality match (eq)
Numeric fields: Supports:
Equality (eq)
Greater than (gt)
Less than (lt)
Range filtering (e.g., min/max or between operators)
### Sorting

Query parameter format: ?sort=field.asc or ?sort=field.desc
Multiple sort keys may be supported where applicable.
### Pagination (Offset-Based)

Default limit: 500
Supports limit and offset parameters
The API response includes:
```json
{
  "data": [ /* array of records */ ],
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 500,
  "totalRecords": 1342,
  "hasMore": true,
  "nextPageUrl": "/api/items?offset=500&limit=500",
  "previousPageUrl": null,
  "filtersApplied": {
    "status": "active"
  },
  "sort": "createdAt.desc"
}

ADR Template
Document 
I've created a comprehensive ADR template based on the structure from your example. The template includes all the key sections and provides guidance on what to include in each part:

Header section with title, date, and status
Context for describing the problem and options considered
Decision stating what was chosen
Reasoning explaining why (with subsections for different benefit categories)
Consequences covering both positive and negative impacts
Implementation Notes for technical details
Related Decisions for linking to other ADRs
References for external sources
The template uses placeholder text in brackets to guide you on what content to include in each section. You can customize it further based on your team's specific needs or standards.
